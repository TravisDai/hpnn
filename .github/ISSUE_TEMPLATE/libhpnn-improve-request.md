about: suggest a improvement in API
title: "[IMPROVE]"
labels: improve

Contrary to [BUG] reports or [FEATURE] requests, an [IMPROVE] request deals with (mostly) simplification in libhpnn API, for a working (no BUG tag), existing (no FEATURE tag) process.

**Currently**
Describe step by step, in the present API, the required procedure to perform your specific task with libhpnn.
 
**Reason for improvement**
Describe the reason that suggest a change in the API is necessary. For example, there could be too much, useless, or redundant API calls, or the same API call made too many times.

**Suggestion of improvement**
Please suggest a change in the API that would resolve the previous complex steps while retaining the same functionality.
