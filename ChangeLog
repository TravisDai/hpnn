LIBHPNN - v. 0.1 (2019)
This is the first version of libhpnn (obviously).
Very alpha, with a lot of potential BUGS.
FEATURES:
	* type ANN is ready: simple feedforward NN with a sigmoid activation.
		* OpenMP implemetation: OK
		* CUDA implematation: OK
		* MPI implementation: OK
		* MPI + OpenMP implemetation: OK
		* MPI + cuda: TODO (started)
		* OpenMP + cuda: TODO (started)
		* MPI + OpenMP + CUDA: TODO (started)
	all NN implementation can be run and trained, consistently, which means that
they should all give the exact same answer*.

* The tolerance is calculated over the absolute sum of the elements and within a
criterion of 10^{-14}, and <10^{-12} for for all the data vectors (including the
hidden ones), and all weights matrix, respectively.
