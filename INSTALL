LIBHPNN INSTALL
---------------
_______________

  In this INSTALL file, the preparation, compilation, and installation processes 
of the libhpnn library is detailed.
 A simple installation procedure is briefly discussed in the README or README.md
files, which correspond to the I-1 section of this file.

I-1 Simple installation
***********************

The libhpnn uses a GNU/autotool strategy to get its prerequisite libraries. This
means that installation can be as simple as:
```
% ./autogen.sh
[... some output ...]
% ./configure
[... some more output ...]
% make all
[... still some more output ...]
```
And that should put the compiled libhpnn library into the lib directory.
An additional:
```
% sudo make install
[... guess? ...]
```
will install libhpnn into a system directory where it can be directly linked and
used. For example compiling a software that require libhpnn with gcc, one should
only have to add the appropriate -l switch.
```
% gcc my_prog.c -lhpnn
```
Of course that depends on how your system is configured.

At the configure step, using `--prefix=/path` option will install the library at
the /path root, it means that `libhpnn.h`,  and `libhpnn.a` will be installed as
`/path/include/libhpnn.h`,  and `/path/lib/libhpnn.a`, respectively.
In case you wish to use a non-standard path -or one that is not recognize by gcc
compiler- you can still use the library with -I and -L switches:
```
% gcc -I/path/include my_prog.c -L/path/lib -lhpnn
```

I-2 Specific libraries
**********************

libhpnn relies on effective BLAS, OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA libraries. On most cases
this means that a simple installation similar to the previous section will _not_
leads to an optimized libhpnn.
