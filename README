LIBHPNN version 0.2
-------------------

This README is supposed to provide a minimal description of the high performance neural network (hpnn) library, for use with a package and/or source-only distribution. It is not aimed at replacing the README.md file which is the official README of libhpnn project.

I - introduction
----------------

HPNN library aimed to provide an easy API to create, optimized, and use artificial neural networks (ANNs) "on the fly" while using a regular (ie. without ANN) program.
The ANNs call to library would hopefully slowly replace the computation intensive part of a program, while improving its ANNs on each run, in a predictor-corrector fashion.

III - Installation
------------------

The installation of libhpnn relies on the autotools system.
Usually only a few steps are required to produce the library:
```
./autogen.sh
./configure
make all
make install
```
The latter may require elevated privileged depending on the installation target directory, which can be modified by the `--prefix=` switch.

For advance instruction and specific combination of compilers or libraries, please see the INSTALL file.
